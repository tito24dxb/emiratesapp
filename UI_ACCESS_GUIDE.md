## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "I don't see Seller Dashboard"
**Solution**: Scroll down the sidebar - it's below Marketplace

### "I don't see the chat"
**Solution**: Chat only appears after clicking "Contact Seller" on a product page

### "Contact Seller button is disabled"
**Solution**: You're viewing your own product - you can't message yourself

### "I don't see My Earnings"
**Solution**: Look in sidebar or navbar profile menu - it's labeled "My Earnings" not "Billing"

### "Share button doesn't work"
**Solution**: Make sure you're on a product detail page, not the marketplace grid
